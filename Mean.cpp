    2 - Overloaded Functions to calculate mean for given data and print it and also return it
    If Argument is a single array and the number of elements, it refers to Ungrouped data
    If Argument is 3 Arrays and the number of intervals, it refers to Grouped data (Lower limit, Upper Limit, Frequency)
    Function prints Mean Value and also returns the Mean Value
